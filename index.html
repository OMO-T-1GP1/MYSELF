                <h3>ABOUT MYSELF</h3>
                <P>my name is Sa'adah Yusuf.She is  12 years old.she is a muslim, a native Ilorin Kwara state nigeria.
                The name of my parents are MR and MRS Yusuf,she has two younger brothers Abdulsalam and Mohammad.
                I moved to Ibadan when I was 4 years old so i spent most of my life there.
                we change our residence often due to one reason or another so i had to go to three different schools.
                The name of of first school is QIBLAH PREPARATORY SCHOOL(QPS)
                That was the first school i went to when we first got to Ibadan
                So I started grade two in that school we moved to two houses before I finished the school.
                When we moved to the last house I was in grade 4 and was planning  to do my common entrance.
                I had my common entrance during covid and because my dad is a doctor and was exposed to alot of patient,
                he couldn't tutor me so I had to study on my own.
                And I passed so I was getting promoted.
                During covid we had new neighbors the Tijani family we were very close to them
                they just got back from Saudi Arabia that time.
                After the lockdown my parents told me i couldn't go to the school anymore because it was far from our house
                Maryam our neighbor and my best friend was also going to the same class as me,
                So our parents decided to take us to the same school and madrsah.
                We saw each other everyday.</p>
                <h3>WHERE I AM LIVING</h3>
                <p>I am in SAUDI ARABIA now I was happy at first but it is so boring here.
                When I moved to SAUDI ARABIA my friend moved to CANADA and we don't talk much often.
                But luckily we have nigerian neighbors in the same building as us so a little bit not boring.
                And to make it less boring there is a park directly infront of our house and we go there almost everynight.
                Life here as been fun but not as fun as with my friends.</p>
