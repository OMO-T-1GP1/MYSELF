                <h3>ABOUT MYSELF</h3>
                <P>My name is Sa'adah Yusuf. I am 12 years old. I am a muslim,I am a native Ilorin Kwara state nigeria.</P>
                <p>The name of my parents are MR and MRS Yusuf, I have two younger brothers Abdulsalam and Mohammad.</p>
                <p>I moved to Ibadan when I was 4 years old so i spent most of my life there.</p>
                <p>We change our residence often due to one reason or another so i had to go to three different schools.</p>
                <p>The name of my first school is QIBLAH PREPARATORY SCHOOL(QPS)</p>
                <p>That was the first school i went to when we first got to Ibadan</p>
                <p>So I started grade two in that school we moved to two houses before I finished the school.</p>
                <p>When we moved to the last house I was in grade 4 and was planning  to do my common entrance.</p>
                <p>I had my common entrance during covid and because my dad is a doctor and was exposed to alot of patient,</p>
                <p>he couldn't tutor me so I had to study on my own.</p>
                <p>And I passed so I was getting promoted.</p>
                <p>During covid we had new neighbors the Tijani family we were very close to them</p>
                <p>they just got back from Saudi Arabia that time.</p>
                <p>After the lockdown my parents told me i couldn't go to the school anymore because it was far from our house</p>
                <p>Maryam our neighbor and my best friend was also going to the same class as me,</p>
                <p>so our parents decided to take us to the same school and madrsah.</p>
                <p>We saw each other everyday.</p>

                <h3>WHERE I AM LIVING</h3>
                <P>I am in SAUDI ARABIA now I was happy at first but it is so boring here.</P>
                <p>When I moved to SAUDI ARABIA my friend moved to CANADA and we don't talk much often.</p>
                <p>But luckily we have nigerian neighbors in the same building as us so a little bit not boring.</p>
                <p>And to make it less boring there is a park directly infront of our house and we go there almost everynight.</p>
                <p>Life here as been fun but not as fun as with my friends.</p>
